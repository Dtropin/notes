✦ Destructors should never emit exceptions. If functions called in a
destructor may throw, the destructor should catch any exceptions,
then swallow them or terminate the program.

✦ If class clients need to be able to react to exceptions thrown during
an operation, the class should provide a regular (i.e., non-destructor)
function that performs the operation.


✦ Don’t call virtual functions during construction or destruction, because
such calls will never go to a more derived class than that of
the currently executing constructor or destructor.
