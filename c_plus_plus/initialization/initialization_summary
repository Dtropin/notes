Manually initialize objects of built-in type, because C++ only sometimes
initializes them itself.

✦ In a constructor, prefer use of the member initialization list to assignment
inside the body of the constructor. List data members in
the initialization list in the same order they’re declared in the class.

✦ Avoid initialization order problems across translation units by replacing
non-local static objects with local static objects.


✦ Make sure operator= is well-behaved when an object is assigned to
itself. Techniques include comparing addresses of source and target
objects, careful statement ordering, and copy-and-swap.

✦ Make sure that any function operating on more than one object behaves
correctly if two or more of the objects are the same.
