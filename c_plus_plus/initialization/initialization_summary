Manually initialize objects of built-in type, because C++ only sometimes
initializes them itself.

✦ In a constructor, prefer use of the member initialization list to assignment
inside the body of the constructor. List data members in
the initialization list in the same order they’re declared in the class.

✦ Avoid initialization order problems across translation units by replacing
non-local static objects with local static objects.
